# Ops Challenge: Python Conditionals

## Overview

Conditionals are an important tool in any language and see plenty of use in Python. Today, you will be using "if statements" in Python.

## Notes

- In Python, a logical conditional is a statement that evaluates a condition to either True or False.
- Logical conditionals are used in conditional statements to control the flow of a program based on the outcome of the condition.
  - if statements and loops
- Python provides several logical operators that can be used to create logical conditionals. These operators include:
  - `==` checks if two values are equal
  - `!=` checks if two values are not equal
    - `!` is sometimes informally referred to as the "bang" operator.
  - `<` checks if one value is less than another
  - `<=` checks if one value is less than or equal to another
  - `>` checks if one value is greater than another
  - `>=` checks if one value is greater than or equal to another

- Logical conditionals are often used in combination with boolean operators, like `and`, `or` and `not` to create more complex conditions by combining multiple logical conditions.
  - The `and` operator returns True if both conditions on its left and right sides are True. If any of the conditions is False, it returns False.
  - The `or` operator returns True if at least one of the conditions on its left and right sides is True. If both conditions are False, it returns False.
  - The `not` operator is a unary operator that negates the value of a condition. If the condition is True, the `not` operator returns False, and if the condition is False, it returns True.
