# Final Exam & Project Kickoff

Today we'll have a guest instructor present on the topic of Diversity and Inclusion. Next we'll review Ops 301, preview Ops 401, then assemble project teams and work on deciding each team's project topic. Final exam will be unlocked.

## Class Outline

- Review of Ops 301 in preparation for final exam
- Preview of Ops 401
- Project Team formation
- Project Topic assignment
- Final Exam open

## Lab Environment for Cybersecurity 401

- Don't tear down the lab environment! You'll need that virtual ecosystem to simulate threats in 401.
  - pfSense as the router/firewall
  - Windows Server as the DC
  - Windows 10 as the "typical endpoint"
  - Kali Linux as the external attacker
  - Second pfSense to help represent any external networks
