# Routing

## Overview

Enterprise network administrators use routing skills to handle large and complex multi-router topologies or connections. ISP backbone routers can and do malfunction on occasion, causing routing problems for everyday users. Routing issues can also arise when configuring VPN tunnelling between two complex LANs.

Routing is a fundamental mechanic in the overall operations of not only networks but the internet at large. In today's lab you'll practice configuring BGP on two routers.

## CompTIA Questions

- You need to implement wireless but canâ€™t use the 2.4 GHz range because of interference issues. What wireless standard can you implement at the 5 GHz range to get 54 Mbps?
  - 802.11ac
  - The IEEE 802.11a, n, ac, and ax are standards in in the 5 GHz range.
- When all routers in a network agree about the path from one point to another, the network is said to be what?
  - When the routing tables are complete because they include information about all networks in the internetwork, they are considered converged.
- You have a user who cannot resolve names on the local network and the Internet. All other users can do so without difficulty. Although there can be many issues causing this problem, which of the following is a possibility?
  - If you statically add a DNS configuration on a host, it will override the information provided to the host by the DHCP server. By using the ipconfig utility, you can verify that the DNS server addresses are the correct addresses.
